## This repository holds all files for programming assignments and takehome exams I created for COSI 153, Mobile App Development, at Brandeis Univeristy in Summer 2024.

### The Exams and Videos folder, is hidden from github view in order to not allow any cheating or copying of code.

### This repository includes the following projects:

----------------------------------------------------------------

- Exam1: Files for takehome exam 1, recreating the area of triangle app, given the image of an app I recreated it to be as similar as possible, both styles and functionality.  

- Exam2: File for takehome exam 2, adding a username and passowrd global variable to be accessible on all parts of the site. 

- Flower_shop_app: File for the flower_shop_app that is the main project for the class. 

### Flower Shop App Edit History 

1. 6-11-24
- As of right now, it features a home page with navigation to other pages, and an occation page that lets peeople choose the given occasion and propmts them to fill out a survery form. Will continue to work on this project throughout the course. 

2. 6-13-24 
- Updated the main page, added global variables "username" and "password" and a log in botton, which takes users to a services page, with more bottons to the other six pages. Tried to make a scroll view but was not able will try again at a later date. Also created a header that displayed username that will be applied to all the pages. Also began on working on the gallery. The idea is for it to look like a scrap book that usser's can flip through to see pictures of flowers, got the main book to work need to keep working with the pages themselves to add pictures.
